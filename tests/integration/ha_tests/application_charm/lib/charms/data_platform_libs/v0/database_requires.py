"""Relation 'requires' side abstraction for database relation.

This library is a uniform interface to a selection of common database
metadata, with added custom events that add convenience to database management,
and methods to consume the application related data.

Following an example of using the DatabaseCreatedEvent, in the context of the
application charm code:

```python

from charms.data_platform_libs.v0.database_requires import DatabaseRequires

class ApplicationCharm(CharmBase):
    # Application charm that connects to database charms.

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)

        # Charm events defined in the database requires charm library.
        self.database = DatabaseRequires(self, relation_name="database", database_name="database")
        self.framework.observe(self.database.on.database_created, self._on_database_created)

    def _on_database_created(self, event: DatabaseCreatedEvent) -> None:
        # Handle the created database

        # Create configuration file for app
        config_file = self._render_app_config_file(
            event.username,
            event.password,
            event.endpoints,
        )

        # Start application with rendered configuration
        self._start_application(config_file)

        # Set active status
        self.unit.status = ActiveStatus("received database credentials")
```

As shown above, the library provides some custom events to handle specific situations,
which are listed below:

— database_created: event emitted when the requested database is created.
— endpoints_changed: event emitted when the read/write endpoints of the database have changed.
— read_only_endpoints_changed: event emitted when the read-only endpoints of the database
  have changed. Event is not triggered if read/write endpoints changed too.

If it is needed to connect multiple database clusters to the same relation endpoint
the application charm can implement the same code as if it would connect to only
one database cluster (like the above code example).

To differentiate multiple clusters connected to the same relation endpoint
the application charm can use the name of the remote application:

```python

def _on_database_created(self, event: DatabaseCreatedEvent) -> None:
    # Get the remote app name of the cluster that triggered this event
    cluster = event.relation.app.name
```

It is also possible to provide an alias for each different database cluster/relation.

So, it is possible to differentiate the clusters in two ways.
The first is to use the remote application name, i.e., `event.relation.app.name`, as above.

The second way is to use different event handlers to handle each cluster events.
The implementation would be something like the following code:

```python

from charms.data_platform_libs.v0.database_requires import DatabaseRequires

class ApplicationCharm(CharmBase):
    # Application charm that connects to database charms.

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)

        # Define the cluster aliases and one handler for each cluster database created event.
        self.database = DatabaseRequires(
            self,
            relation_name="database",
            database_name="database",
            relations_aliases = ["cluster1", "cluster2"],
        )
        self.framework.observe(
            self.database.on.cluster1_database_created, self._on_cluster1_database_created
        )
        self.framework.observe(
            self.database.on.cluster2_database_created, self._on_cluster2_database_created
        )

    def _on_cluster1_database_created(self, event: DatabaseCreatedEvent) -> None:
        # Handle the created database on the cluster named cluster1

        # Create configuration file for app
        config_file = self._render_app_config_file(
            event.username,
            event.password,
            event.endpoints,
        )
        ...

    def _on_cluster2_database_created(self, event: DatabaseCreatedEvent) -> None:
        # Handle the created database on the cluster named cluster2

        # Create configuration file for app
        config_file = self._render_app_config_file(
            event.username,
            event.password,
            event.endpoints,
        )
        ...

```
