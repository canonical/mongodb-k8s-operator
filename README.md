# MongoDB Operator

## Description

The [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) operator provides a general
purpose distributed document database. This repository contains a
[Juju](https://jaas.ai/) Charm for deploying MongoDB on Kubernetes
clusters.


## Setup

A typical setup using [snaps](https://snapcraft.io/), for deployments
to a [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) cluster can be done using the
following commands

    sudo snap install microk8s --classic
    microk8s.enable dns storage registry dashboard
    sudo snap install juju --classic
    juju bootstrap microk8s microk8s
    juju create-storage-pool operator-storage kubernetes storage-class=microk8s-hostpath

## Build

Install the charmcraft tool

    sudo snap install charmcraft

Build the charm in this git repository

    charmcraft build

## Usage

Create a Juju model for your operators, say "lma"

    juju add-model lma

Deploy a single unit of MongoDB using its default configuration

    juju deploy ./mongodb.charm

It is customary to use MongoDB with replication. Hence usually more
than one unit (preferably and odd number) is deployed. Additionally
units (say two more) may be deployed using

    juju add-unit -n 2 mongodb
    
Alternatively multiple MongoDB units may be deployed at the
outset. This is usually faster

    juju deploy -n 3 ./mongodb.charm

If required, remove the deployed monitoring model completely

    juju destroy-model -y lma --no-wait --force --destroy-storage

Note the `--destroy-storage` will delete any data stored by MongoDB in
its persistent store.

## Relations

Currently supported relations are

- Peer relations for replication
- Provides a `mongodb` database interface.

## Developing

Use your existing Python 3 development environment or create and
activate a Python 3 virtualenv

    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Install the development requirements

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

## Testing

Just run `run_tests`:

    ./run_tests
